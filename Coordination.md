### SQL 
- [x] Add in more mock data via mockaroo or similar.
- [x] Add in bridge tables (which imo is great news -- we wont have to build a front end for the a few features)
      Done by Fabrizio, organized the mock data and added some for the bridge tables. Rearanged entire SQL database
- optional: [x] Change attribute types where possible to enumberation (is this helpful?)
            - I (Fabrizio) could do this as it would make the attribute make more sense, but not sure if its useful now?

### REST API
- [ ] Implement REST API to python (imo im not sure we need as many rows as we have -- which is also good news)
